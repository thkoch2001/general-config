# Available notification methods: "desktop", "xmpp", "all", and "none".
# Default if not specified is "desktop" and indicates that KDE/Gnome/notify 
# notifications (typically in the tray area) should be used to inform the user
# when anything noticable happens. "none" disables notifications altogether
# and "xmpp" causes notifications to be sent via XMPP to the account specified
# in the "alsonotify" option in section [xmpp]. "all" will send notifications
# to both desktop and xmpp.
notifymethod = desktop

# There are currently two options for handling file notifications, as neither 
# one is perfect. You can choose between the 'conservative' option, which is
# slower but should work in every corner case, and the 'optimized' option, 
# which will consume less CPU and I/O resources on a remotely-triggered pull,
# but may miss local changes until the next time autosync is restarted or a
# manual commit is done on the repository.
#
# The problem is that during a pull from the remote repository, changes will
# be applied to the local file system and consequently generate file-changed
# events. These events are in turn translated to add/remove/move commands for
# the DVCS, which would duplicate the remote changes locally in the history and
# obviously doesn't work e.g. for file removes. Therefore, the file/dir changes
# caused by a remote pull must not be translated to local DVCS changes.
# The conservative strategy solves this problem by completely suspending event
# handling while the pull is active. Because it is possible that _real_ local
# changes occur concurrently to the pull, the startup command will be run after
# the pull has been finished and event processing was resumed again. This is a
# safe option, as all local changes that occurred before or during the pull
# will be picked up by the DVCS client. However, when no local changes occurred
# (which is more probable), then this strategy causes unnecessary I/O overhead.
#
# The optimized strategy also suspends the execution of local DVCS actions 
# triggered by file/directory events during the pull, but does not completely
# discard them. Instead, all events that occurred during the pull are recorded
# in an event queue which is replayed after the pull has finished. The 
# advantage is that a complete re-scan of the local repository is avoided and
# only those files/directories that saw some modification are re-checked for 
# local changes. The disadvantage is that this depends more strongly on the
# change detection capabilities (trivial ones done by autosync-dvcs and more
# complex ones done by the respective DVCS client) and it is therefore not 
# guaranteed that all local, concurrent changes are being detected. This option
# is still being evaluated for corner cases where it doesn't work, and 
# therefore is not yet the default strategy.

# The number of seconds to wait for additional events before acting. Setting
